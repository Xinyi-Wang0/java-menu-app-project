# My Personal Project

An application for browsing the daily menu of the canteen. It allows
you to upload information about the dishes sold by the food court
each day. Possible features include viewing the different types of 
dishes offered each day; listing the raw materials for all dishes; 
the price of each dish.

The canteen manager can update the daily menu and students can view
the menu. The reason I'm interested in this is that lunchtime is short
every day during the school year, some people have a hard time making
a choice quickly, and people don't know much about what's in other
countries' dishes, they may have their own taboos. I wanted to use
this app to save people time and get some insight into the food.
